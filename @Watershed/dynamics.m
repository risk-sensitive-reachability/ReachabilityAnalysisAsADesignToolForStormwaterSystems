% PURPOSE: A function that describes the system dynamics, used by 
%          HJIPDE_solve in helperOC. It has definitions for both
%          the two-state and three-state scenario options. If a two-state
%          simulation is run, the dynamics of the third state will not be 
%          evaluated.
% INPUT:
    % obj, deriv, uMode, parameters used by HJIPDE_solve
    % tau = t_max - t [seconds], where t is the current time in simulation space
    % x = state vector 
% OUTPUT: vector of state changes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

function dx = dynamics(obj, tau, x, u, d)

%initialize your dx in each dimension of the state space
dx = cell(obj.nx, 1);

%turn everything into cells
returnVector = false;
if ~iscell(x)
    returnVector = true;
    x = num2cell(x);
    u = num2cell(u);
    d = num2cell(d);
end

%solve dx for each dimension of the state space
for i = 1:length(obj.dims)
    dx{i} = dynamics_i(x, tau, u, d, obj.dims, obj.dims(i));
end

%give back a matrix if need be
if returnVector
    dx = cell2mat(dx);
